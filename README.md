# Accounting-System
I developed Henry's Financial Frontiers, a comprehensive ledger keeping and accounting system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), and PHP. The project focused on streamlining financial record management by providing features such as ledger entry management, department organization, and employee data handling. By leveraging these technologies, I created a user-friendly interface with real-time updates and robust validation checks, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. Henry's Financial Frontiers showcases my expertise in web development and my ability to design intuitive solutions for complex financial tasks.
